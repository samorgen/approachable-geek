## About The Project

This project was created as a technical assessment for Approachable Geek. It demonstrates a functional profile page for a mock phone app.

### Built With

- React Native
- Javascript
- Expo

### Prerequisites

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/samorgen/approachable-geek.git
   ```

2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Install the [Expo Go app](https://expo.dev/client) on your IOS or Android phone and connect it to the same wireless network as your computer.

## Usage

To use this app, go to the root folder of the project and run

```sh
   npm start
```

The program will generate a QR code that can be scanned to open the app within Expo.

Note: It may take a few seconds to load all the packages the first time the project loads in Expo. If Expo becomes disconnected, shake your phone to view a menu where you will find an option to reload the page.
